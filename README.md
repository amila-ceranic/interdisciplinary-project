# Comparative Analysis of qPCR and dPCR for SARS-CoV-2 Detection in Wastewater

This repository contains all code used for an interdisciplinary project at TU Wien. The project focuses on evaluating the consistency, efficiency, and comparability of qPCR and dPCR methods in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples.

## Contents

- InterdicsiplinaryProject_final.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with complete analysis and visualizations
- requirements.txt: List of Python packages required to run the notebook
- README.md: Description and usage instructions

## Project Summary

Wastewater-based epidemiology is a powerful method for tracking virus spread in populations. This project compares TU Wienâ€™s qPCR and dPCR results against national monitoring data. Analyses include:

- Technical replicate consistency
- Mean virus concentration comparison
- IPC behavior and extraction efficiency
- Regression modeling (Linear and RANSAC)
- Adjustment for extraction efficiency

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
